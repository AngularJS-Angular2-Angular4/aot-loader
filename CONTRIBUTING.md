# Make a change

To setup `@ultimate/aot-loader` for development, run the following -

```bash
git clone git@github.com:UltimateAngular/aot-loader.git
cd aot-loader
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will start watching for changes to any source files, and compile/bundle the source.

You'll then need to open up the generated `dist` folder and run `yarn link`.

Then, inside a different project that's running webpack (for example, our `ng-boilerplate`), run:
 
```bash
yarn link @ultimate/aot-loader
```

You'll then be using your local version as the loader.
